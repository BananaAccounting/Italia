            Book Overview : The book has been written by Steve Souders,
            is one of the most elaborate one's discussing the performance parameters.
            In the words of Nate Koechley, Senior Frontend Engineer Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Team,
            Platform. As a frontend engineer, you hold a tremendous amount of power and responsibility.
            Youre the users last line of defense.The decisions you make directly shape their experience.
            I believe our number one job is to take care of them and to give them what they wantquickly.
            This book is a toolbox to create happy users (and bosses, too).Best of all,
            once you put these techniques in placein most cases, a one-time tweakyoull be reaping the rewards far into
            the future.

        <Title>Blog-2 :The Importance of Frontend Performance</Title>

            Most of my web career has been spent as a backend engineer.As such, I dutifully
            approached each performance project as an exercise in backend optimization, concentrating
            on compiler options, database indexes, memory management, etc.Theres
            a lot of attention and many books devoted to optimizing performance in these areas,
            so thats where most people spend time looking for improvements.In reality, for
            most web pages, less than 1020% of the end user response time is spent getting the
            HTML document from the web server to the browser.If you want to dramatically
            reduce the response times of your web pages, you have to focus on the other 8090%
            of the end user experience.What is that 8090% spent on? How can it be reduced?
            The chapters that follow lay the groundwork for understanding todays web pages
            and provide 14 rules for making them faster.

            In order to know what to improve, we need to know where the user spends her time
            waiting.Figure A-1 shows the HTTP traffic when Yahoo!s home page (http://www.
            yahoo.com) is downloaded using Internet Explorer.Each bar is one HTTP request.
            The first bar, labeled html, is the initial request for the HTML document.Th e
            browser parses the HTML and starts downloading the components in the page.In
            this case, the browsers cache was empty, so all of the components had to be downloaded.
            The HTML document is only 5% of the total response time.The user spends
            most of the other 95% waiting for the components to download; she also spends a
            small amount of time waiting for HTML, scripts, and stylesheets to be parsed, as
            shown by the blank gaps between downloads.
